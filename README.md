## Landscape

SoundHound AI Inc. deals in the Voice Recognition, Speech Interpretation and Natural Language Processing (NLP) fields.

Speech recognition technology has been a subject of interest since the 1950s pioneered by Bell Laboratories who introduced the first example of modern speech recognition software called "Audrey" which could understand numbers from 1 to 9 said only by its developer. IBM introduced the Shoebox in 1962 which was able to recognize and differentiate between 16 spoken English words in addition to the numbers 1 to 9. 

In the early 1970s, the Department of Defense invested 5 years into Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's ([DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/)) Speech Understanding Research program. A prominent invention from the program was "Harpy". "Harpy" was able to recognize over 1000 words. Little progress was made in the field following DARPA's research until the late 1980s when scientists started moving more towards Natural Language Processing. They started using algorithms to program systems with the rules of the English language instead of just using sounds, allowing machines to make an educated guess by assessing its options against correct syntactic, semantic, and tonal rules if the system had trouble recognizing a word. 

In 1990, Dragon introduced its first speech recognition software, "Dragon Dictate" and later "Naturally Speaking" in 1997 which allowed natural speech to be processed without the need for pauses.

It was not until 2010 that Google brought speech recognition technology to the forefront of innovation with the introduction of their Google Voice Search app. Siri was introduced just 1 year later by Apple, becoming instantly famous for her ability to accurately process natural utterances and ability to respond using conversational language. Siri's success fueled innovation in the field and was soon joined by Amazon's Alexa and voice recognition technologies have since been integrated into computers, video games, cars, smartphones, watches, appliances and a plethora of other voice activated/controlled devices in English as well as other languages.

Other companies that hold a stake in this field are Shazam, Google, Nuance Communications, Deepgram and Fano Labs to name a few.

## Results

SoundHound AI Inc. has had a positive impact on the NLP market thus far with integration into automobiles, IoT devices and recent acquisition of SYNC3 Restaurant Solutions. SoundHound AI remains a leader in voice AI with continuous investment in research and development.

## Recommendations

As the creator of the most used music recognition software, SoundHound, they should consider developing a AI driven music generation app/platform that would allow musicians, both professional and amateurs, to create their own music. They could also have a platform similar to SoundCloud to showcase only AI generated music created by their users.

I believe this would allow amateurs who would like to create music a chance to share their musical ideas and visions without necessarily having to learn an instrument or tinker with complex music creation softwares like [Reason](https://www.reasonstudios.com/) in turn creating a previously untapped, unexplored market in music creation.
